Introduction
------------

Welcome, and thanks for your interest in Bitsquare. 

What is Bitsquare?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bitsquare is a cross-platform desktop application that allows users to trade 'fiat money' (dollars, euros, etc) for bitcoin without relying on centralized exchanges such as Coinbase, Bitstamp or (the former) Mt. Gox.

By running Bitsquare on their individual computers, users work together to form a peer-to-peer network. Through the Bitsquare interface, users broadcast offers to buy and sell bitcoin on that network. The process of offering and accepting these trades results in a fully functioning, yet totally decentralized marketplace.

[[getting-started]]
Getting Started
---------------

This is alpha software.

We recommend that you follow the steps in <<getting-started>>


Download and install Bitsquare
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mac OS X
^^^^^^^^

Download the Bitsquare {download-baseurl}.dmg[.dmg image]. Open it, and copy Bitsquare to your `/Applications` folder.

TODO: screenshot

Linux
^^^^^

Linux users on Debian- or Ubuntu-based distributions can download the Bitsquare {download-baseurl}.deb[.deb package] and install it using `dpkg`. Linux users on other distributions can {devguide-url}#build-from-source[build from source].

Windows
^^^^^^^

A Windows MSI installer will be https://github.com/bitsquare/bitsquare/issues/108[included in a future release]. Until then, Windows users can {devguide-url}#build-from-source[build from source].

Take a quick tour
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this point you can launch Bitsquare from your operating system's application menu. Take a look around the UI. You'll see that certain screens such as _Overview_, _Preferences_ and _Messages_ are not implemented yet. And you'll see that _Buy BTC_, _Sell BTC_, _Orders_, _Funds_ and _Account_ are. You'll see how to use each of these in the sections below.
